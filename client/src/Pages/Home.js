                    With several years of advanced customer service experience in leadership roles, Ellen excels in having an active line of communication with the client. During her education at Northwestern, Ellen most notably contributed to a full stack website that would serve as a catalog and calculator to build price quotes for a custom framing store. Ellen created the schema for the database and wrote the back-end connections in JavaScript from MongoDB into a React application and designed and wrote a majority of the entire front-end while delegating other critical components and research tasks to her team. As a Business Analysis and Software Engineer for Bank of America, her focus has shifted towards data and analytics and ETL-oriented planning and execution. During her short time under contract for the Bankâ€™s Rates Market Data team, her confidence as a leader, skills as an meticulous analyst, and fluency in computer science and business-oriented language and requirements have proven her an invaluable asset to the team.
